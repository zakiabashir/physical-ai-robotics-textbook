# Specification Quality Checklist: Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics Textbook

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-12-05
**Feature**: [Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics Textbook](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Lesson Structure Validation

- [x] Book content specification defined (4 chapters × 3 lessons)
- [x] Lesson requirements clearly specified (6 core components)
- [x] Visual learning requirements included
- [x] Content structure mandates for each chapter defined
- [x] Key entities reflect lesson components

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Notes

- Specification updated to include detailed lesson requirements
- All 12 lessons must include: objectives, explanations, code examples, diagrams, labs, summaries and quizzes
- Content structure mandates ensure consistent organization across all chapters
- Visual learning requirements support diverse learning styles
- Ready for planning phase with complete lesson specification
