In this post, we'll guide you through setting up ROS 2 and understanding its core concepts.\n\n<!-- truncate -->\n\n## What is ROS 2?\n\nROS 2 is a set of software libraries and tools that help you build robot applications. It provides:\n\n- **Communication infrastructure** for distributed systems\n- **Hardware abstraction** to work with different sensors and actuators\n- **Package management** and build tools\n- **Visualization and debugging** tools\n\n## Installing ROS 2\n\n### Ubuntu/Linux\n```bash\n# Set locale\nsudo apt update && sudo apt install locales\nsudo locale-gen en_US en_US.UTF-8\nsudo update-locale LC_ALL=en_US.UTF-8 LANG=en_US.UTF-8\nexport LANG=en_US.UTF-8\n\n# Add ROS 2 apt repository\nsudo apt install software-properties-common\nsudo add-apt-repository universe\nsudo apt update && sudo apt install curl -y\nsudo curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ros/rosdistro/master/ros.key -o /usr/share/keyrings/ros-archive-keyring.gpg\necho \"deb [arch=$(dpkg --print-architecture) signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/ros-archive-keyring.gpg] http://packages.ros.org/ros2/ubuntu $(. /etc/os-release && echo $UBUNTU_CODENAME) main\" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/ros2.list > /dev/null\n\n# Install ROS 2 Humble\nsudo apt update\nsudo apt install ros-humble-desktop\n```\n\n### Windows\n1. Download the latest ROS 2 installer from the [official website](https://docs.ros.org/en/humble/Installation/Windows-Install-Binary.html)\n2. Run the installer and follow the wizard\n3. Open a Command Prompt and source the setup file:\n```cmd\ncall C:\\dev\\ros2\\humble\\local_setup.bat\n```\n\n## Core Concepts\n\n### 1. Nodes\nNodes are the smallest executable units in ROS 2. Each node performs a specific task:\n\n```python\n#!/usr/bin/env python3\nimport rclpy\nfrom rclpy.node import Node\n\nclass MyRobotNode(Node):\n    def __init__(self):\n        super().__init__('my_robot_node')\n        self.get_logger().info('Robot node started!')\n\ndef main():\n    rclpy.init()\n    node = MyRobotNode()\n    rclpy.spin(node)\n    rclpy.shutdown()\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    main()\n```\n\n### 2. Topics\nTopics are named buses for exchanging messages:\n\n```python\n# Publisher\nself.publisher = self.create_publisher(String, 'robot_status', 10)\n\n# Subscriber\nself.subscription = self.create_subscription(\n    String,\n    'commands',\n    self.command_callback,\n    10\n)\n```\n\n### 3. Services\nServices provide request-response communication:\n\n```python\n# Service Server\nself.srv = self.create_service(\n    AddTwoInts,\n    'add_two_ints',\n    self.add_two_ints_callback\n)\n```\n\n## Useful Commands\n\n```bash\n# List all running nodes\nros2 node list\n\n# View node information\nros2 node info /my_robot_node\n\n# List topics\nros2 topic list\n\n# View topic data\nros2 topic echo /robot_status\n\n# Check topic frequency\nros2 topic hz /robot_status\n\n# Call a service\nros2 service call /add_two_ints example_interfaces/srv/AddTwoInts \"{a: 5, b: 3}\"\n```\n\n## Next Steps\n\n1. **Practice with turtlesim**: A simple simulator for learning ROS 2\n2. **Explore URDF**: Learn to describe robot models\n3. **Try Gazebo**: Advanced robot simulation\n4. **Build a project**: Create your own robot application\n\n## Resources\n\n- [Official ROS 2 Documentation](https://docs.ros.org/en/humble/)\n- [ROS 2 Tutorials](https://docs.ros.org/en/humble/Tutorials.html)\n- [ROS 2 Answers](https://answers.ros.org/)\n\nHappy robot building! 🤖\n\n---\n\n*Need help?
