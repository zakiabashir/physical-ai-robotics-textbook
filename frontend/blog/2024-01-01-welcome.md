## What is Physical AI?

Physical AI represents the convergence of artificial intelligence and robotics, where intelligent systems interact with and manipulate the physical world. Unlike traditional AI that exists purely in digital spaces, Physical AI:

- **Perceives** the world through sensors
- **Reasons** about physical interactions
- **Acts** upon the environment through motors and actuators
- **Learns** from real-world feedback

## Why Humanoid Robotics?

Humanoid robots represent one of the most exciting frontiers in Physical AI. By mimicking the human form, these robots can:

- Operate in environments designed for humans
- Use tools and equipment meant for human use
- Interact naturally with people
- Perform complex tasks requiring human-like dexterity
